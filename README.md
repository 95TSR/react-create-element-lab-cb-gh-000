# React createElement() Lab

## Objectives

1. Practice using `createElement()`
2. Build a simple view using `createElement()`

## Overview

Students should build and render a simple view — this is a good opportunity to
introduce `props` more fully. Maybe students can build a simple contact form?
We'll need to use `defaultValue` — it's a little early to introduce controlled
components — but it will give us something to test.

About tests: everything'll be easier if you use `mocha` and the test script
that's provided in this lab. You can use any setup that you'd like — Babel works
well for compiling students' code — but make sure that the tests are reported in
a valid `.results.json`.
